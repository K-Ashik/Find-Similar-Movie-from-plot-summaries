## Find Similar Movies from Plot Summaries

In the Find Movie Similarity from Plot Summaries project, I have used NLP and clustering to find the similarities between movie plots. It is the perfect project if you are looking to apply statistical techniques to text data.

I have imported two datasets, combine them, perform tokenization and stemming, convert words into vectors, and use KMeans to perform clustering. Furthermore, you will calculate similarity distance and visualize the results using Matplotlib, Linkage, and Dendrograms.
